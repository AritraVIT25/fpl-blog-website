    <div class="post-meta">Gameweek 1 • Community Breakdown</div>
    <img src="../images/mancitygw1image.jpg" alt="Manchester City players gather in front of the Etihad Stadium crowd celebrating a goal, Haaland at the center with arms raised and a focused expression, teammates smiling and congratulating him, stadium seats filled with cheering fans, vibrant and energetic mood" class="post-img" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem auto;" />
      <p>Manchester City’s 4–0 demolition of Wolves wasn’t just a footballing statement—it was an <strong>FPL earthquake</strong>.  
      With prices freshly revealed, which players are worth jumping on and which are early-season traps? Here’s the lowdown.</p>

      <div class="note"><strong>Quick Picks:</strong> Haaland (essential), Reijnders (£5.5m gem), Rico Lewis (£5.0m bargain). Watch Cherki & Bobb as rotation punts.</div>

      <!-- Haaland Section -->
      <h2>⚡ Erling Haaland — The Undisputed Essential</h2>
    <img src="../images/haalandgw1.jpg" alt="Erling Haaland celebrating after scoring, arms outstretched with a determined expression, teammates approaching to congratulate him, Etihad Stadium crowd visible in the background, energetic and triumphant mood" class="post-img" style="max-width:400px; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem auto;" />
      <p><strong>Price:</strong> <span class="price">£14.0m</span> | <strong>GW1 Points:</strong> <span class="pts">13</span></p>
      <p>A brace, bonus points, and the same old story. Haaland is still the most reliable captain option in the game.  
      Yes, he’s expensive, but there’s no FPL squad without him. The question isn’t “Haaland or no Haaland” — it’s who you pair him with.</p>

      <!-- Reijnders Section -->
      <h2>🎯 Tijjani Reijnders — Budget Breakthrough</h2>
    <img src="../images/reijndersgw1.jpg" alt="Tijjani Reijnders raising his arms in celebration after scoring for Manchester City, joyful expression, surrounded by cheering teammates and fans in the stadium, energetic and optimistic atmosphere" class="post-img" style="max-width:300px; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem auto;" />
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> <span class="price">£5.5m</span> | <strong>GW1 Points:</strong> <span class="pts">10</span></p>
        <p>A dream Premier League debut with a goal and an assist. Reijnders immediately looks like the <em>perfect fifth midfielder</em>.  
        If his minutes remain stable, he could be the best enabler in the game this season.</p>

        <!-- Oscar Bobb Section -->
        <h2>✨ Oscar Bobb — Differential Delight</h2>
        <img src="../images/bobbgw1.jpg" alt="Oscar Bobb celebrating with arms raised, smiling as teammates approach, Manchester City fans cheering in the background, lively and upbeat mood" class="post-img" style="max-width:300px; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem auto;" />
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> <span class="price">£5.5m</span> | <strong>GW1 Points:</strong> <span class="pts">6</span></p>
        <p>Creative, lively, and already delivering points. Bobb is Pep roulette in human form, but at £5.5m he’s worth keeping an eye on.  
        If he nails down a starting spot, he’s a golden differential.</p>

        <h2>🛡️ Defense — Rico Lewis Leads the Way</h2>
        <p><strong>Rico Lewis (£5.0m, 11 pts)</strong> stood out at the back. Out-of-position in phases, cheap, and reliable so far.  
        <strong>Aït-Nouri (£6.0m)</strong> also impressed, but feels slightly overpriced. Dias & Stones (both £5.5m) remain safe but unspectacular picks.</p>

        <h2>🚨 Risks & Traps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gvardiol (£6.0m)</strong> – flagged, wait and watch.</li>
            <li><strong>Foden (£8.0m)</strong> – zero points GW1, upside remains but monitor minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Rodri / Kovačić</strong> – deep-lying roles, very low FPL ceiling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>✅ Verdict</h2>
        <p>Man City’s GW1 confirmed what we already knew: <strong>Haaland is essential</strong>.  
        The real excitement lies in the new supporting cast — <strong>Reijnders</strong> as a bargain enabler, <strong>Lewis</strong> as a defensive value pick, and <strong>Bobb</strong> as a risky-but-fun differential.</p>

        <div class="note">Suggested triple-up: Haaland + Reijnders + Lewis. Add Cherki or Bobb only if you enjoy the chaos of Pep’s roulette.</div>
