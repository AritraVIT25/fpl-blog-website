      <h1 class="section-title">João Pedro to Chelsea: FPL Value Destroyed?</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Published: July 3, 2025 | Transfer Analysis</p>

      <div class="article-image-wrapper">

      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Chelsea have completed the signing of João Pedro from Brighton in a £30 million move, bringing another technical attacker into their ever-changing forward line. Pedro, who scored 11 goals and registered 5 assists last season, was also Brighton’s primary penalty taker. But at Chelsea, that role is likely gone, and so might be his FPL value.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
          <h3>Key FPL Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Penalty Duties: Expected to lose them to Cole Palmer</li>
            <li>Rotation Risk: Competing with Jackson, Nkunku, Madueke, and more</li>
            <li>FPL Price: Expected between £7.0m–£7.5m</li>
            <li>Brighton Impact: Welbeck and Rutter may become viable budget picks</li>
            <li>Verdict: Avoid unless he nails down a starting role</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Pedro's minutes were always somewhat inconsistent at Brighton, but his FPL value was helped by spot-kick duties and an advanced role. At Chelsea, the competition for places is much stiffer. Between Palmer, Nkunku, Delap, and even Gittens, Pedro’s path to a locked-in starting role is far from guaranteed.</p>

        <p>From Brighton’s point of view, this departure opens the door for other options. Danny Welbeck could reclaim penalties, and Georginio Rutter might benefit from a more central attacking role. For FPL managers seeking budget-friendly forwards or midfield punts, Brighton’s new setup deserves monitoring during pre-season.</p>

        <p>Enzo Maresca’s tactical flexibility means we may see João Pedro in a false nine, winger, or secondary striker role depending on the game state. This unpredictability might keep his ownership low, but also makes him a frustrating FPL asset. Unless he’s showing excellent form and regular starts in pre-season, he’s best avoided early on.</p>

        <p>Pedro was a troll pick last season for many managers who held through blanks and benchings. Now at Chelsea, the risks may be even higher. His underlying data remains solid, but without guaranteed minutes or penalties, his ceiling drops significantly compared to safer options in the same price range.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "He was already a rotation risk before, but now he's competing with Delap, Jackson, Madueke, Nkunku and Gittens as forwards while being stuck in Maresca roulette. There's also no way Palmer isn't on pens."

        <blockquote>
          "Yeah, this move surely kills him as an FPL asset. At least he won't troll me this season I guess."

        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          "Could make Welbeck more appealing as a budget forward option if he becomes Brighton's main penalty taker."
