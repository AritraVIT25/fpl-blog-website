      <p class="article-meta">Published: July 4, 2025 | Transfer Rumors</p>

      <div class="article-image-wrapper">

      </div>

      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Manchester United are reportedly preparing a bid for Ollie Watkins, fresh off his stellar 2024/25 campaign with Aston Villa. The English striker scored 16 goals and provided 8 assists, helping Villa secure a Europa League spot. His mix of pressing, link-up play, and positional awareness makes him a potential tactical fit for Erik ten Hag’s system. If this transfer materializes, FPL managers may need to quickly reassess their forward line strategies.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
          <h3>Key FPL Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Projected Price: £7.5m–£8.0m in FPL</li>
            <li>2024/25 Stats: 16 goals, 8 assists in 34 matches</li>
            <li>Work rate and hold-up play match Amorim's pressing system</li>
            <li>Could become United’s first-choice striker</li>
            <li>Fixtures: United’s opening run includes 3 home games in 5</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Watkins’ style of play could complement the attacking profiles of Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho. His tendency to drop deep and link with midfield runners may unlock United’s stagnant offensive phases. However, one concern among FPL managers is how United’s inconsistency might affect Watkins’ output. Villa provided him with a structured system—something United have struggled to replicate in recent seasons.</p>

        <p>From a fantasy standpoint, Watkins offers reliability. He rarely misses matches, maintains a decent minutes-per-return rate, and is often involved in both goals and assists. However, his ceiling may be slightly capped if United continue their tactical identity crisis. Despite this, his relatively affordable price tag keeps him in the conversation, especially for managers building around premium midfielders.</p>

        <p>If Watkins joins United and gets minutes early in preseason, his ownership will spike before Gameweek 1. But with FPL being a game of fine margins, managers must evaluate whether he’s a starter or part of a striker rotation. An early substitution pattern or shift in formation could lower his value. Preseason form, injury updates, and transfer dominoes around him (like Martial or Højlund) will also influence his fantasy prospects.</p>

        <p>In summary, Watkins to United is a high-floor, medium-ceiling move from an FPL lens. He offers consistency, fitness, and decent attacking returns. Yet unless United themselves become more fluid and ruthless in attack, his FPL potential might remain more safe than explosive. Managers who prefer stable forwards rather than risky differentials may find him a reliable third striker.</p>
