      <h1 class="section-title">Rodrygo to Arsenal: FPL Gamechanger or Rotation Risk?</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Published: July 6, 2025 | Transfer Analysis</p>

      <div class="article-image-wrapper">

      </div>

      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Arsenal are reportedly increasing their efforts to sign Real Madrid winger Rodrygo in a £70 million deal, with the Brazilian international viewed as a potential upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli. The 24-year-old has become a peripheral figure under new Madrid manager Xabi Alonso, who struggles to accommodate Rodrygo alongside Vinicius Jr., Kylian Mbappé, and Jude Bellingham in his preferred system.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
          <h3>Key FPL Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Expected Price: £8.0m–£8.5m (likely midfielder)</li>
            <li>2024/25 Stats: 12 goals, 7 assists in all competitions</li>
            <li>Competition: Faces Martinelli and Trossard for LW spot</li>
            <li>Potential set-piece involvement</li>
            <li>Arsenal have a favorable opening fixture run</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Rodrygo’s arrival at Arsenal could shake up the FPL midfield landscape. He offers directness, finishing ability, and Champions League-level experience. If priced reasonably and given regular starts, he could become a mid-price gem.</p>

        <p>But the risk is real. Martinelli is still young and productive. Trossard is trusted. Bukayo Saka has the RW spot locked down. Unless Arteta changes his system or someone leaves, minutes could be shared. Rodrygo might start slowly, and FPL managers will need patience.</p>

        <p>There’s also a chance he gets a share of set pieces, which could elevate his appeal further. But that’s speculation until we see pre-season friendlies. It’s possible he’s eased in and rotated for the Champions League in the early months.</p>

        <p>Still, the upside is real. He’s shown he can deliver in big moments at Madrid. If he adjusts quickly to the Premier League and earns trust from Arteta, Rodrygo could become a top 10 midfield pick by GW10.</p>

          "Rodrygo at Arsenal could be massive for FPL if he nails down a starting spot. His underlying numbers at Madrid were excellent when he played."

        <blockquote>
          "Another Arsenal midfielder? We already have Saka, Ødegaard, and potentially Eze. This just creates more rotation headaches."

          "People sleeping on Rodrygo because of 'Premier League proven' bias. This guy has won Champions Leagues – he'll cook if he comes."
