      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Crystal Palace’s dream season hit a roadblock after UEFA ruled them ineligible for the Europa League, despite their FA Cup triumph. The issue stems from multi-club ownership conflicts involving American investor John Textor. While fans celebrate a historic cup win, the ruling has triggered frustration and reshaped the European qualification landscape.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
          <h3>Key FPL Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Rotation risk increases with Conference League games</li>
            <li>Fixture congestion may affect team consistency</li>
            <li>Palace’s transfer budget could shrink due to revenue loss</li>
            <li>Nottingham Forest assets get a boost with Europa League upgrade</li>
            <li>May increase Palace motivation in Premier League matches</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The ruling stems from UEFA’s multi-club ownership rule, which prevents a single entity from influencing two clubs in the same competition. John Textor’s ties to Lyon (also qualified for the Europa League) created a conflict. Although Palace attempted restructuring, they missed the March 1 deadline for compliance. As a result, UEFA awarded their spot to Nottingham Forest.</p>

        <p>From an FPL lens, this shift is critical. Palace’s Conference League campaign could force Maresca into more rotation, reducing the reliability of key picks like Eze, Olise, and Wharton. However, it could also allow them to prioritize domestic form, boosting their value in certain fixture runs. It’s a dynamic worth tracking in early season planning.</p>

        <p>The financial ramifications are no less severe. The Europa League brings significantly more prize money and broadcasting exposure than the Conference League. This could limit Palace’s transfer activity, diminishing their squad depth—again impacting FPL potential and future investment appeal.</p>

        <p>UEFA’s decision has also sparked debate about fairness. Fans quickly pointed out how larger clubs like Manchester City and Red Bull Leipzig have found ways around similar restrictions. Palace's failure to meet the deadline is being contrasted with the leniency shown to giants using legal maneuvers.</p>

          "Palace missed the deadline. End of story. Everyone knew about March 1. It's on the owners, not UEFA."

        <blockquote>
          "Honestly, if it means they go deeper in the Conference League and do better in the league, I’m all for it. Silver lining for FPL maybe?"
