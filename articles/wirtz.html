      <h1 class="section-title">Florian Wirtz: Liverpool’s £116m FPL Game-Changer</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">Published: July 3, 2025 | Transfer Analysis</p>

      <div class="article-image-wrapper">
        <img src="../images/wirtz.jpg" alt="Florian Wirtz in action for Bayer Leverkusen" class="article-image" />
      </div>

      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Florian Wirtz has officially signed with Liverpool in one of the biggest transfers of the summer window, valued at a record-breaking £116 million. The 21-year-old was Bayer Leverkusen’s creative engine, delivering 18 goals and 19 assists across competitions last season. FPL managers are already debating his price point, which is expected to land between £8.5m and £9.0m. Given Liverpool’s attacking DNA, Wirtz could be a dream pick for early-season hauls.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
          <h3>Key FPL Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Projected Price: £8.5m-£9.0m</li>
            <li>2024/25 Bundesliga Stats: 14 goals, 15 assists in 32 matches</li>
            <li>Preferred Role: Central Playmaker (CAM)</li>
            <li>Possible Set-Piece Duties</li>
            <li>Liverpool Start: Favorable First 5 Fixtures</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Arne Slot is known for developing young attacking midfielders, and Wirtz fits that mold perfectly. His quick decision-making, one-touch play, and tactical intelligence make him a strong candidate to inherit the #10 role. With Szoboszlai and Mac Allister beside him, Liverpool’s midfield will now have increased creative balance. This could lead to more big chances created—and indirectly, more fantasy points for Wirtz and his teammates.</p>

        <p>From an FPL perspective, Wirtz offers the tantalizing blend of creativity and goal threat. Compared to other midfield options, he provides better value than high-cost names like De Bruyne or Fernandes, especially if he nails down set-piece duties. Managers will want to monitor preseason friendlies for any sign of rotation risk or position tweaking. But if he starts GW1, he may become one of the most transferred-in players by Gameweek 3.</p>

        <p>It's worth noting that while he has no Premier League experience, Wirtz has played at a high level in Europe, including the Europa League and Champions League. His ability to handle pressure, coupled with strong finishing instincts, makes him more than just a flair signing. If he can adapt quickly to the intensity of English football, he may become a fixture in many squads for months to come.</p>

        <p>To conclude, Florian Wirtz is more than just a new signing—he’s a potential FPL cheat code waiting to happen. He has youth, form, and system fit all working in his favor. If preseason form matches expectations, there's little reason not to take the plunge. Smart managers will be watching this space closely.</p>
